# HW0 – Producer and Consumer (Go)
The main file is:  
- `hw0.go` → contains both Producer and Consumer in one program.  

The Producer starts the Consumer as another process.  
They use pipes to send numbers and "ack" messages to stay in sync.  

-----------------------------

## How to Run both problems:
Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.25.x or newer// does matter linux/macos or windows enviroment).  

Open a terminal inside the `hw0/` folder and run:
go run hw0.go/
